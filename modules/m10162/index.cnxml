	In the previous chapters, we considered the problem of digital
	transmission over different channels.  Information sources are
	not often digital, and in fact, many sources are
	analog. Although many channels are also analog, it is still more
	efficient to convert analog sources into digital data and
	transmit over analog channels using digital transmission
	techniques.  There are two reasons why digital transmission
	could be more efficient and more reliable than analog
	transmission:
	<list id="list1" list-type="enumerated">
	  <item>
	    Analog sources could be compressed to digital form
	    efficiently.
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    Digital data can be transmitted over noisy channels
	    reliably.
	  </item>
	</list>
	There are several key questions that need to be addressed:
	<list id="list2" list-type="enumerated">
	  <item>How can one model information?</item>
	  <item>How can one quantify information?</item>
	  <item>
	    If information can be measured, does its information
	    quantity relate to how much it can be compressed?
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    Is it possible to determine if a particular channel can
	    handle transmission of a source with a particular
	    information quantity?
	  </item>
	</list>
      </para>

	<para id="para2">
	  The information content of the following sentences: "Hello,
	  hello, hello." and "There is an exam today." are not the
	  same.  Clearly the second one carries more information.  The
	  first one can be compressed to "Hello" without much loss of
	  information.

	In other modules, we will quantify information and find
	efficient representation of information (<link document="m10164">Entropy</link>).  We will also quantify
	<link document="m10173">how much </link> information can be
	transmitted through channels, reliably.  <link document="m10174">Channel coding</link> can be used to reduce
	information rate and increase reliability.
